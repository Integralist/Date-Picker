[Integralist](http://www.integralist.co.uk/) - Date Picker
================================

Description
-----------

Date picker widget.

TODO
-----------------

* Use a template engine (either home grown or existing - such as Mustache.js)
* Maybe remove any reliance on a library (although my Standardizer library is just basic convenience methods, people may prefer to just have the core functions that are used moved out into the main date-picker script)
